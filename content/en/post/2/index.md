The past week at university was busy and productive. I actively attended lectures and seminars, paying special attention to difficult topics that required extra time to understand. I focused especially on preparing for upcoming tests â€” reviewing key concepts, solving practical problems, and analyzing mistakes to avoid them in the future.

Additionally, I participated in group projects, which helped improve my teamwork skills and deepen my understanding of the subjects through discussions with classmates. In my free time, I engaged in self-study by exploring additional literature and materials, which broadened my horizons and better prepared me for exams.

Despite the intense schedule, I tried to maintain a balance between studying and rest to keep a high level of motivation and productivity. Overall, the week went well, and I feel confident in my knowledge and ready for new challenges in my studies.
