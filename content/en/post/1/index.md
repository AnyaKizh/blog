## General Information About the Week

Last week, my days were filled with interesting events and discoveries. I followed my usual schedule for half of the week, but starting from May 8th, due to Victory Day, the days from the 8th to the 11th were holidays.

## Events

During this week, I not only had a good rest but also worked productively, because next week I will have tests and quizzes, so I needed to prepare.

## Preparation for Next Week

I had to prepare for quizzes in mathematical analysis and linear algebra, as well as for a test in mathematical logic, so I studied diligently all week. In the first few days, I reviewed all the necessary topics in mathematical logic, then completed the homework for linear algebra to better understand the subject. I finished my preparation with mathematical analysis and getting ready for the quiz on integrals.
