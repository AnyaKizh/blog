CI/CD is not just trendy abbreviations but key practices for modern software development. They enable teams to build and release software faster, more reliably, and with fewer errors.

## CI (Continuous Integration):

- Developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository.
- Automated builds and tests run with every integration.
- Issues are detected early, making them easier to fix.

## CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):

- Automates the process of delivering code changes to various environments (testing, staging, production).
- Continuous Delivery: Changes are ready to be deployed to production at any time but require manual approval.
- Continuous Deployment: Changes are automatically deployed to production after passing all tests successfully.

## In summary, CI/CD allows you to:

- Accelerate the release of new features and updates.
- Improve code quality through automated testing.
- Reduce risks associated with deployments.
- Make the development process more predictable and efficient.
